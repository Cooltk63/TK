Hi Team,

As per the communication from Bhargav Sir, this is a reminder to submit your daily task updates before leaving the office each day. Failure to provide your updates will result in the day being marked as No Work.

To align with this directive, please ensure to send your task details by 7:00 PM, which is the common office leave time, or earlier if you complete your tasks sooner.

This process is critical for maintaining accountability and smooth workflow. Please adhere to this requirement moving forward. If you have any questions or face challenges, do let me know.

Thank you for your cooperation.

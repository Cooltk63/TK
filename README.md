Note: Annotation processing is enabled because one or more processors were found
  on the class path. A future release of javac may disable annotation processing
  unless at least one processor is specified by name (-processor), or a search
  path is specified (--processor-path, --processor-module-path), or annotation
  processing is enabled explicitly (-proc:only, -proc:full).
  Use -Xlint:-options to suppress this message.
  Use -proc:none to disable annotation processing.

Hi Team,

As per the communication from Bhargav Sir, this is a reminder to submit your daily task updates before leaving the office each day. Failure to provide your updates will result in the day being marked as No Work.

Please note, recently some team members have been forgetting to share their daily task updates, requiring frequent personal reminders. This is not feasible on a regular basis and affects overall workflow.

To avoid such situations, ensure to send your task details by 7:00 PM, the common office leave time, or earlier if you finish your work sooner.

This process is critical for maintaining accountability and smooth operations. Let me know if you have any challenges or concerns regarding this.

Thank you for your cooperation.

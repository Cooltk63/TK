Got it — you want help setting a goal for a team member who tends to get confused and take a long time to complete tasks.

Here’s a suggestion for how you could frame the goal:


---

Goal:
"Improve task clarity and execution speed by developing a structured approach to work."

Specific Objectives:

Before starting any task, summarize the understanding of the requirement in writing and get quick confirmation (if needed).

Break tasks into smaller steps and create a checklist before starting execution.

Clarify doubts early rather than proceeding with assumptions.

Aim to complete assigned tasks within agreed timelines with minimal confusion.

Track and reflect: At the end of each task, note 1-2 things that caused confusion and how to avoid them next time.


Measurement:

80% of tasks completed on or before the deadline without rework due to misunderstanding.

Noticeable reduction in the number of clarification rounds needed per task over the next 2 months.

Would you also like a version that sounds even more supportive, like for a development plan or appraisal comment?

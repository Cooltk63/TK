Dear [Senior's Name],

We are currently facing an issue while installing packages using npm on all developer machines.
The installation fails with a 403 Forbidden error, even with proxy settings configured.

Please find the attached screenshot for reference.

It seems like access to the NPM registry is blocked or restricted on the network.

Requesting your support to escalate this to the concerned team for resolution.

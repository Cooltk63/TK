I wanted the as usual color which is blue for message in INFO category logs 

log.error("Error Message!");  I need bold red
 
I need whole new different colors for below log messages
 log.trace("Trace Message!");      
 log.debug("Debug Message!");     
 log.info("Info Message!");     
 log.warn("Warn Message!");      
 log.fatal("Fatal Message!");
 
 Could you provide the configuration for using the latest and advanced way to logging in Spring boot application and also I wanted additional functionality like logs rotation Every day new log file created & last file renamed

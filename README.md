Subject: Re: BS Revamp Project Plan Update

Hi Anil,

As requested, I have prepared the detailed plan capturing granular-level activities, along with the planned start and end dates for each task. The Excel sheet with the updated information is attached for your reference.

Regarding the creation of a single DB and elimination of schema-based setup, we will aim to complete it within the same timeline. However, please note that there could be minor extensions in case of any unforeseen or uncertain issues.

Do let me know if you need any further details or modifications.

Thanks & Regards,
Falguni Rajan Nakhwa

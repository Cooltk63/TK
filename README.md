Subject: Concern Regarding Team Member's Behavior and Confidentiality Breach

Dear [Manager's Name],

I’m writing to raise a personal concern regarding [Team Member's Name].

Recently, [he/she/they] have spoken to me in an arrogant and disrespectful tone during our interactions. I find this behavior unprofessional and personally unacceptable. I expect mutual respect in all work-related communication.

Additionally, I was surprised to learn that [Team Member's Name] is aware of the performance rating I gave during the appraisal process — specifically, that I lowered it by 0.10. This information was confidential, and I’m concerned about how it was leaked. This raises serious questions about the handling of sensitive data.

If this behavior and breach of confidentiality are not addressed, I will have no choice but to escalate the matter to HR, as it is directly affecting me and my working environment.

I would appreciate your support in resolving this issue promptly.

Best regards,
[Your Full Name]
[Your Designation]

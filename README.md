Subject: Concern Regarding Team Member's Behavior and Confidentiality Breach

Dear [Manager's Name],

I’m writing to raise a personal concern regarding [Team Member's Name].

During recent conversations, [he/she/they] have spoken to me in an arrogant tone and have responded in a disrespectful manner. I find this behavior unacceptable and unprofessional. I expect basic respect in all work-related interactions, regardless of the discussion topic.

Additionally, I’ve come to know that performance ratings, which are meant to be confidential, have been leaked. I believe this is a serious issue and raises questions about how such sensitive information became available to team members.

If this behavior continues or is not addressed, I will have no choice but to escalate the matter to HR, as it is directly affecting me and my ability to work comfortably and respectfully.

I request your support in resolving this at the earliest.

Best regards,
[Your Full Name]
[Your Designation]

Dear [Helpdesk Team/Specific Contact Name],

I am writing this email as a serious escalation of an unresolved issue. I have already raised this problem multiple times regarding my inability to take remote access from my machine. Each time, I have been informed that the issue is due to an incomplete Trend Micro scan.

However, I have proof of successful Trend Micro scan completion, and despite sharing this earlier, the issue still persists. This repeated response without proper resolution is not acceptable, as it is severely impacting my work.

I request the following actions on priority:

1. A thorough technical investigation into the root cause, instead of attributing it to Trend Micro scans repeatedly.


2. A definitive solution to enable remote access without any further delays.


3. If this cannot be resolved by the first-level helpdesk, kindly escalate this to the next support tier or assign it to someone who can handle this issue effectively.



This is the third (or mention number) time I am reaching out for the same problem, and I expect a clear resolution timeline this time. Kindly treat this as urgent.

Looking forward to a quick and concrete response.

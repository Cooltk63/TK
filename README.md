Subject: Reminder: Submit Daily Task Updates with Time Segregation

Dear Team,

As a reminder, while submitting your daily task updates, please ensure that if you are working on multiple tasks, you segregate the time spent on each task and also mention the total time worked for the day.

This will help in maintaining accurate records and ensuring transparency in our workflow. Kindly make it a practice to follow this format going forward.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Example Format:

Task 1: [Description] – [Time Spent]

Task 2: [Description] – [Time Spent]

Total Time Worked: [Total Hours]


Looking forward to your timely updates.

Best regards,

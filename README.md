Subject: Updated Milestone Planning and Request Regarding Yearly Reports

Hi [Manager's Name],

As requested, I have updated the milestone planning, factoring in the inclusion of freshers working on the project. However, I would like to highlight that there might be some uncertainty, as new team members will be adjusting to the project work, and setting milestones with this in mind may involve some unpredictability.

Additionally, I would like to request that the yearly reports be considered for inclusion in the new change request (CR) or planned for the next quarter.

Please let me know if you need any further details or clarifications.

Thanks & Regards,
[Your Name]

Would you like a few more versions depending on the tone you want (formal, slightly casual, very brief)?

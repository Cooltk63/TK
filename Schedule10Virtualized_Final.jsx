// ‚úÖ FINAL Schedule10 Component (Merged)
// - Virtualized Table Rendering with react-window

// Your original logic (SFTP, initial loading, FormInput, calculations) are all intact.
// Virtualization is safely inserted inside <TableBody> to render rows efficiently.

// Key Imports Required (confirm installed):
// npm install react-window react-virtualized-auto-sizer

// Copy & Paste this file content directly into Schedule10.jsx (or import as needed).
